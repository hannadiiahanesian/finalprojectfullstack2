      h2 Let me tell you about the Pokemon movie!
      p
        | The Pokemon of Ash Ketchum, Misty, and Brock are sent to spend a day at a theme park built for Pokemon. Pikachu, Togepi, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle cross paths with a group of bullies consisting of a Raichu, Cubone, Marill, and a Snubbull. The two groups compete against each other in sports, but it leads to Ash's Charizard getting its head stuck in a pipe. Pikachu, his friends, and the bullies work together and successfully free Charizard and rebuild the park, spending the rest of the day playing before parting ways when their trainers return.
